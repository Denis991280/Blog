Blog Project

Overview:
A blogs web app made with react, display a list of blogs and add functionality to add, delete, and update them. Each blog will have their own comments and the user will create new comments.

Requirements:
<!-- Create a github repository -->
<!-- Create a new react app using vite -->
<!--Create a form to create each blog (title, image, description, author, publish date) (( useState + onClick + onChange ))--> 
<!-- Display all the blogs dynamically (( mapping on the array of objects, each object is a blog)) -->
<!-- For every blog add a delete button that removes the blog from the array (( if you update the state it will re-render on the screen )) -->
<!-- For every blog add a like and dislike counter -->
<!-- For every blog add a show comments button that when clicked: -->
<!-- Conditionally renders the comments list underneath the blog (( starts empty, so it is an empty array  )) -->
<!-- Conditionally change the button text from “show comments” to “hide comments” and when clicked again it should hide the comments section for that specific blog -->
<!-- When showing the comments, the user will find 2 inputs to add their name and the message they wish to comment -->
